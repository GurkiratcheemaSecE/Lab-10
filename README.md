# Lab-10 report
I wanted to make a webstite about the top 6 cities in canada and to just add picture and some brief information about them . 
My design choice was simple/basic and the theme color of the website is blue.
Everything was much easer to do because of bootstarp I used the hero section , the cards and the contact from it . 
Overall I did not have any problems puting this website togerth as it was just a basic website with little functionalites .
